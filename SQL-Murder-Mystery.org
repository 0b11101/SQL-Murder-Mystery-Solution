|           | number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags.      |

Going to look for more evidence! Jared says this sounds like a serial killer name--extra damning.

* THE MURDERER IS....
Jeremy Bowers as suspected....
* Final-ish Result
Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.
* Jeremey Bowers confesion
| Name   | Transcript                                                       |

|        | I was hired by a woman with a lot of money.                      |
| Jeremy | I don't know her name but I know she's                           |
| Bowers | around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives |
|        | a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL                |
|        | Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.                       |
This has now officially turned into a game of S'Clue'L --credit Jared Churbuck
* Miranda Priestly 
Caught her with this:
#+begin_src sql
/*  
  5'5" (65") <= Height <= 5'7" (67")
  Hair color: red
  Make: Tesla
  Model: Model S
  Facebook: Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017
  
  Tables needed: drivers_license, person, facebook_event_checkin, income? 
*/

select p.name
from person p
join drivers_license dl
	on p.license_id = dl.id
join facebook_event_checkin f
	on p.id = f.person_id
where dl.hair_color is 'red' 
		and dl.car_make is 'Tesla' 
		and dl.car_model is 'Model S'
		and dl.height > 64 and dl.height < 67
		and f.date >20171131 and f.date < 20180101
#+end_src
Gave me a table with her name three times as expected.
Result: "Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. Time to break out the champagne!"
